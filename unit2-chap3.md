## 3.1 Introduction to Pathogenicity

### 3.1.1 Pathogenicity vs. Virulence

**Pathogenicity** refers to a bacterium’s ability to cause disease. It is a qualitative concept. A **pathogen** is a bacterium that is capable of harming a healthy host. Note that capable means that it may cause harm to a healthy host, but it does not mean it always will. A healthy host means an individual whose defence mechanisms are not compromised in any substantial fashion. On the other hand, an **opportunistic pathogen** is a bacterium that harms a **compromised host**, i.e., a host whose immune defence system is weakened. For example, *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* causes few infections in healthy individuals but more than 200,000 infections per year in hospitalized individuals in the U.S.

**Virulence** is a measure of the pathogenicity of a microorganism, i.e., it is a quantitative concept.  Virulence can be expressed as the cell number that will elicit a pathogenic response in the host within a given time period. For example, an infection with a relatively small number of highly virulent bacteria (*Streptococcus pneumoniae*) will kill a certain number of mice, whereas an infection with much more of less virulent bacteria (*Salmonella typhimurium*) is required to kill the same number of mice (Fig 109) (1).

``` 

The terms pathogenicity and virulence are related in that pathogens can express a wide range of virulence factors. This is a property of the organism that determines the extent of the disease. The extent of the virulence is usually correlated with the ability of the pathogen to multiply within the host and may be affected by factors such as route of entry and the general health/susceptibility of the host. A microorganism can be defined as being a pathogen and depending upon conditions within the host, may exhibit different levels of virulence.

A highly **virulent organism** causes disease in most individuals with whom it comes in contact. An **avirulent organism** rarely, if ever, causes disease in human beings. Between these two extremes there is a range of virulence possessed by microorganisms.  The virulence of microorganisms is directly attributable to the fact that they possess certain factors (called **virulence factors**) which allow it to enter and colonize in the host, resist the immune defences of the host, and cause damage in the host. A few of these virulence factors will be discussed in this chapter.

### 3.1.2 Bacterial Infections

Bacterial infections may be classified into the following types:

- A **primary infection** is an initial, acute infection.
- A **secondary infection** is a later (or second) infection caused by an opportunistic organism after a primary infection has weakened the host defences.
- A **subclinical infection** is one in which the host has no apparent symptoms.
- A **nosocomial infection** is one acquired as a consequence of hospitalization or the process of receiving health care. These are infections that were not present before entering the health care facility.

Infections may also be differentiated according to the extent of host involvement. This is influenced by the invasiveness of the organism, i.e., the ability of the organism to invade beyond the original site of entry into the host’s body. Some terms describing invasiveness and the spread of disease within a host are listed below.

- A **local infection*8 is restricted to a relatively small area of the body. Non-invasive organisms usually cause these infections.
- A **systemic or (generalized) infection** is one which is spread throughout the body.  Invasive organisms usually cause these infections.
- A **focal infection** begins in a restricted area and then spreads throughout the body.

Host susceptibility influences the outcome during infection.  As mentioned earlier, the interaction between microorganisms and the host is affected by the virulence of the microorganisms and the anti-bacterial defences of the host. The susceptibility to infection is increased if the anti-bacterial defences of the host are compromised. In fact, bacteria with low virulence may cause disease in a compromised host.

The host may be more susceptible to infection if there are factors that compromise the immune defences.  These include: 

- Underlying disease or infection (e.g., AIDS, cancer, inherited immunodeficiencies)
- Stress (e.g., exams)
- Poor nutrition (e.g., a diet which leaves out essential vitamins or minerals) 
- Age (e.g., the underdeveloped immune defences of the newborn and infant leave them susceptible to infection with microorganisms to which the older child or healthy adult is immune.  Similarly, the degeneration of the immune responses which comes with age results in older people being more susceptible to infection.)
- Immunosuppressive therapy (e.g., such as the therapy used in the treatment of certain cancers or maintenance of transplanted organs)
- Genetics of the host’s defence systems. Individuals in the population respond differently to infection.  Genetic diseases can affect susceptibility to infection (e.g., cystic fibrosis and lung infection).  In addition, some individuals are more resistant or susceptible to infections than others, although the molecular differences are not yet understood.

## 3.2 Infecting the host

### 3.2.1 Mode of infection

In order to infect the human body, a bacterium usually has to proceed through a number of steps (Fig 110).

1.	The bacterium has to come in contact with the host’s body.
2.	The bacterium has to adhere to (and transiently colonize) or invade the host.
3.	The bacterium has to multiply.
4.	The bacterium has to evade the host’s innate immune defence system.

In addition, for the bacterium to cause disease, it must possess chemical/molecular mechanisms whereby it damages the host (e.g., toxins or host damaging enzymes), or it must trigger a chronic inflammatory response.

```{figure} Figures/Unit_2/3-2.png

Steps involved in bacterial infection of a host.
``` 

Invasive organisms may cause systemic infections, i.e., the infection can be disseminated throughout the body, often via the blood. This is a concern as bacteria are not normally found in the blood. Since blood is considered sterile, the presence of bacteria in the blood is termed **bacteremia**. 
 
### 3.2.2 Koch’s Postulates

Proving that a specific microorganism causes a specific disease is not a new problem.  Robert Koch, a microbiologist working in the last century, established a set of postulates that allow one to determine whether a relationship exists between a particular organism and a disease.  These postulates have been used as a guide to determine the causes of many important diseases, which led to the development of treatments for the prevention and cure of many infectious diseases. Fig 111 illustrates the traditional steps of Koch’s postulates. Due to advances in science, molecular considerations are now also made in determining whether a microorganism plays a role in a particular disease. 

Koch’s postulates have been used to prove the causative relationship between most bacterial pathogens and their respective diseases. Two major impediments can prevent definitive proof of causation using Koch’s postulates. First, certain bacterial pathogens cannot be cultivated *in vitro*, and second, sometimes there are no animal models for a specific disease.

```{figure} Figures/Unit_2/3-3.png
:name: Fig111

Koch’s postulates.
``` 

Having established through Koch’s postulates that a specific pathogen causes a disease, the next question involves how the pathogen causes disease.  Stan Falkow, the father of molecular pathogenesis, developed a newer set of postulates that allows one to prove that a particular virulence factor or gene is involved in the pathogenesis of an organism:

The Molecular Version of Koch’s Postulates

Applying our understanding of molecular genetics to Koch’s postulates expands them:
1.	The gene(s)/factor should be present in pathogenic strains of the organism and absent from non-pathogenic strains.
2.	The molecular disruption, i.e., deletion of the gene(s), should reduce the virulence of the bacterial strain AND introducing the cloned gene(s) into an avirulent strain should render that strain virulent. 
3.	The gene(s) must be expressed at some point during the infectious process in experimentally infected animals.
4.	Antibody raised against the virulence factor should offer some protection against infection, in an experimentally infected animal.
 
### 3.2.3 Regulation of Genes Encoding Virulence Factors

The disease-causing genes described in the molecular version of Koch’s postulates are referred to as virulence factors. The possession of virulence factors is what allows the pathogenic bacteria to infect normal people and cause disease (Fig 112).  


A particular bacterium may live in many different environments, and in turn may need to regulate the expression of components needed for survival in these varying conditions.  Bacteria turn on these different components, which include virulence factors, only when needed.  Bacteria ‘sense’ several environmental factors in regulating the expression of their various virulence factors.  

```{figure} Figures/Unit_2/3-4.png
:name: Fig112

Summary of virulence factors discussed in this chapter.
``` 

These environmental factors include aspects such as:

- Temperature
- Nutrients
- Oxygen (O2)
- pH inside the cell
- Iron availability
- Osmolarity

Common processes regulated at the genetic level include metabolism, response to environmental stresses and conditions, and cell division.  

Many virulent bacteria have **‘global’ regulatory systems** to regulate virulence factors (i.e., regulatory systems that control the production of multiple different virulence factors at once).  These systems are co-ordinately regulated by a two-component system (Fig 113) that comprises a sensor protein and a regulator protein.  This is a common system for signal transduction as introduced in Unit 1 Chap 5. 

```{figure} Figures/Unit_2/3-5.png
:name: Fig113

Revisiting the two-component regulatory system for signal transduction.
``` 

Applying this to pathogens, the sensor (kinase) protein detects changes in the environment that indicate that the bacterium is residing inside a human host and then phosphorylates the response regulator protein.  The phosphorylated regulator protein then transcriptionally activates or represses the virulence factors (e.g., flagella genes, toxin genes, adhesin genes, capsule genes) by binding to a DNA sequence in the regulatory regions of each of the operons for these virulence factors.  

In the rest of this chapter, we will look at the production of virulence factors that bacteria use to enter and colonize the host, resist the immune defences of the host, and cause damage in the host. Keep in mind that all of these result from transcription and translation of DNA, thus gene regulation always plays a part!


## 3.3 Virulence Factors: Mechanisms of Pathogenic Bacteria

### 3.3.1 Bacterial Adherence

The first host barrier for many invading pathogens is usually a mucosal surface, such as in the gut or respiratory tract.  Therefore, most successful pathogens have evolved specific mechanisms to **adhere** to host tissue.  Simple attachment is mediated through a receptor on the host cell surface (e.g., glycoproteins, glycolipids) and an adhesin (e.g., pili, capsule) on the surface of the bacterial cell (Fig 114).

```{figure} Figures/Unit_2/3-6.png
:name: Fig114

Adherence of pathogens to animal tissues.  Left:  *Vibrio cholerae* (lacking an outer layer or clycocalyx) adhering to the brush border of rabbit villi (2).  Middle:  Enteropathogenic *E. coli* adhering to the brush border of calf villi via an extensive glycocalyx (3).  Right:  A shadow-cast electron micrograph showing type P fimbriae of *E. coli* (4).  
```

These mechanisms benefit the pathogen by facilitating colonization, preventing the removal of the bacterium by non-specific host defence systems and by localizing the bacterium to the appropriate tissue. The specificity of the interaction between the host tissue and bacterium is often both host specific (e.g., *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* will bind to human tissues but not rat tissues) and tissue-type specific (e.g., *E. coli* will bind to the intestinal lumen, but not the pharynx). One of the known bacterial structures known to mediate adherence to host cells it the pili (plur.). **Pili or pilus** (sing.) were introduced in Unit 1 Chapter 2 as thin hair-like structures that protrude through the cell surface. Pili have a range of different functions including motility, conjugation, and host cell adherence. 

The host responds to adherent organisms through:
- Production of antibodies against bacterial surfaces
- Upregulation of production of antimicrobial peptides by epithelial cells
- Phagocytosis of the adherent organisms
- Shedding/destruction of epithelial cells that become colonized with bacteria.

:::


**Overview**

*Neisseria gonorrhoeae*, the causative agent of gonorrhea, is a pathogen with a well-known adherence mechanism mediated by pili. Adherence allows the pathogen to penetrate and attach to host mucosal surfaces. It has been observed that during human infection, the genes coding the pili undergo changes through DNA phase and antigenic variation. This variation aids in avoidance of host defenses and ultimately increases adherence and success in infection. In this study, He et al. isolated variants from six individuals infected with the same initial *N. gonorrhoeae* clone. He et al. hypothesized that variants in pili genes will either increase or decrease adherence abilities and in turn increase or decrease severity of infection.

In order to test this hypothesis, He et al. collected the following data:

**Monitoring adherence and internalization of *N. gonorrhoeae* variants**

The original strain (MS11) and 6 variants were monitored for their ability to adhere to host cells 1.5 h, 3 h, and 6 h post 24-hour incubation. The internalized bacteria (bacteria that have penetrated inside host cells) were quantified by first removing extracellular bacteria using antibiotics, then determining CFUs.


```{margin}
Phase and antigenic variation are features often seen in pathogens as a way of increasing pathogenicity or evading the immune response. It occurs when either express the variable protein, one of many antigenic forms, or no protein at all. This is a mode of producing variation without mutations (5).

**Questions to consider:**

1.	List the adherence capabilities of the studied strains from highest to lowest?
2.	Compare adherence between the three time points, what can you conclude about the role of time during infection?
3.	List the internalization capabilities of the studied strains from highest to lowest?
4.	Do the internalization data support the adherence data, why or why not?
5.	Does this data support the hypothesis that increased adherence capabilities result in increased infection?

### 3.3.2 Capsules

To avoid phagocytosis, many pathogens have evolved surface components that prevent the attachment and engulfment of macrophages and other host cellular immune responses.  This may take the form of membrane bound proteins, slimy polysaccharide **capsules** (Fig 116), or lipopolysaccharides (LPS - Gram-negative bacteria only). These factors prevent the deposition of antibodies and complement on the bacterial surface, avoiding complement-mediated killing and reducing phagocytosis.

## Case Study: *Streptococcus pneumoniae* – A pathogen that uses a capsule to avoid host defenses

:::


**Overview**

*Streptococcus pneumonia*, is an encapsulated pathogen that causes several diseases, notably bacterial meningitis in children. There are more than 90 known polysaccharide capsules that determine the serotype (classifying different variations of a particular microbial structure) of the bacteria. While the cell wall structure of S. pneumonia is known to affect disease severity, Hathaway et al. aims to determine if capsule serotype affects disease severity directly. Therefore, Hathaway et al. hypothesized that changing the capsule type would affect disease severity in an infant meningitis rat model.

In order to test this hypothesis, Hathaway et al. performed the following experiments:

 
**Step 1: Determine infectious capabilities of two *S. pneumonia* serotypes:**

The infectious clinical isolate (serotype 6B) was genetically altered to replace the capsule determining genes with that of another isolate (serotype 7F) ensuring capsule composition to be the only variable. Survival curves and clinical scores of infected rats were measured.

```{margin} clinical score
Clinical scores are a standardized method of evaluating disease severity. In this study, the scoring looked at the following parameters: coma, ability to stand upright, and ability to walk. These scores are also used to evaluate the humane endpoint for animal experiments. Upon reaching too low of a score, animal models are sacrificed (7).
```

**Step 2: Monitoring capsule formation in two S. pneumonia serotypes:**

The ability of each serotype to form capsules was monitored in both the inoculum before infecting the cell then 21 hours after host infection. 
 
```{figure} Figures/Unit_2/3-10.png

Capsule thickness was determined in serotype 6B (a,c) and serotype 7F (b,d) before inoculation of rats (a,b) and recovered from rats 21 h after infection (c,d).

:::{grid-item-card}
**Questions to consider:**

1.	What effect does capsule serotype have on disease severity?
2.	Do the results presented in Figure 117b complement that in Figure 117a?
3.	What are the controls in the experiment depicted in Figure 118?
4.	Based on the images in Figure 118, under what conditions are capsules formed?
5.	Does the data in Figure 118 complement that in Figure 117? Explain?
6.	Does this data support the hypothesis that capsule type affects disease severity?

### 3.3.3 Toxins

Toxins are microbial products that can damage the host. Toxins are capable of causing disease, independent of the bacterium.  For example, the pathogenic bacteria can be killed in a patient, but the disease may persist due to the continued action of the toxin.  There are two types of toxins: **exotoxins and endotoxins**  (Table 3.1 and Fig 119).

**Table 3.1**.  Properties of exotoxins and endotoxins.

Exotoxins compared to endotoxins. 
```

Exotoxins are secreted proteins made by both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.  These toxins may enter the blood circulation and spread to parts of the body and cause damage far from the site of the bacterial colonization.  There are three main categories of exotoxins.  Cytolytic toxins enzymatically attack the cell constituents causing cell lysis (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus hemolysin – lyses red blood cells).  Neurotoxins specifically interfere with nerve cell function (e.g., tetanus toxin).  Enterotoxins affect cells lining the gastrointestinal tract, causing massive fluid secretion (diarrhea, e.g., cholera toxin).  

Exotoxins are extremely potent molecules.  A small dose can have a significant effect on the host.  Since exotoxins are proteins, they are usually heat labile (i.e., activity destroyed by heating to 60–80ºC) and they are immunogenic (i.e., stimulates the immune system to produce neutralizing antibodies).  Vaccination against toxin-mediated diseases can be done by immunization with toxoids. Toxoids are toxins that have been treated with heat or chemicals to make them non-toxic to the patient, but still capable of stimulating the production of neutralizing antibodies.

Endotoxins are released only when the bacteria die or are digested by phagocytic cells. Generally, the name ‘endotoxin’ is equated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which is present in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria.  Gram-positive bacteria produce molecules with similar properties (e.g., lipoteichoic acid, LTA). Since endotoxins are non-protein molecules and are generally heat stable. 

Endotoxin activates macrophages, causing release of inflammatory cytokines (e.g., tumor necrosis factor).  In low doses (<1 mg), a patient might experience fever (i.e., endotoxin is pyrogenic), aches and pains.  In higher doses, there is damage to the circulatory system and shock.  Fluids leak out of blood vessels, blood coagulates, blood pressure drops, organs fail and death may result.  This is commonly known as endotoxin shock. Treatment of endotoxin shock primarily involves supportive therapy.  Antibiotics are not used as they can aggravate LPS/endotoxin release.  A recently introduced treatment is Polymyxin B (antibiotic)-coated beads that can help remove endotoxins from the blood. However, its absolute efficacy is not known.  A vaccine cannot be used since endotoxins are non-protein molecules and they are not very immunogenic.

:::


**Overview**

*Vibrio cholerae*, is the pathogen responsible for the acute diarrheal disease, cholera. This disease is the result of the cholera toxin (CT) which is produced by *V. cholerae* serogroups O1 and O139. Non-O1 and non-O139 strains, referred to as non-agglutinable (NAG), are often non-CT producing and therefore are not the cause of endemic or pandemic outbreaks. Even still, NAG serogroups have been shown to cause infection on occasion. Interestingly, Takahashi et al. identified unique non-O1 and non-O139 *V. cholerae* that possess the CT gene (ctx). Takahashi et al. hypothesized that the presence of *ctx* gene will increase pathogenicity in NAG strains.

In order to test this hypothesis, Hathaway et al. performed the following experiments:

**Step 1: Determine the ability of each strain to cause disease:**

The disease severity was monitored through measurement of fluid accumulation (a marker of disease) in a rabbit ileal loop (ie. small intestine). N16961 is an O1 *V. cholerae* strain, strain No. A is a non-*ctx* containing NAG, and strains No. 1-3 are *ctx* containing NAGs.

(B) The volume of fluid accumulated in the loop (mL) and the length of the ileal loop (cm) were measured, and the fluid accumulation ratio, which was the ratio of the volume of fluid accumulated in the intestinal loop to the length of the loop (mL/cm), was calculated.
```


**Step 2: Measure the production of Cholera toxin in each V. cholerae strain:**

The CT production of each strain was monitored in vitro under two temperature conditions.

**Questions to consider:**

1.	How would you classify the cholera toxin? endotoxin? exotoxin?
2.	Does the presence of ctx genes result in disease? Why or why not?
3.	Does the presence of ctx genes result in CT production? Why or why not?
4.	What are the controls in Figure 120? Figure 121?
5.	Do the results presented in Figure 121 complement those in Figure 120?
6.	Based on the results presented in Figures 120 and 121, what is required for *V. cholerae* to result in intestinal disease?
7.	Does this data support the hypothesis that the presence of *ctx* will increase the pathogenicity in NAG strains?
