## 2.1 Bacteria and Biofilms

### 2.1.1 What is a Biofilm?

**Biofilms** are organized communities of bacteria that are adhered to a surface and surrounded by (enmeshed in) a matrix of **extracellular polymeric substances (EPS)**. The EPS is a slimy, film-like substance produced by the bacteria in the biofilm, and is composed of polysaccharides, proteins and nucleic acids.  A biofilm is often composed of a single bacterial species.  However, some biofilms have been found to contain hundreds of different species of bacteria living together (1).    

Biofilm formation occurs as a result of coordinated chemical signaling between cells (called **quorum sensing**) (2). Quorum sensing uses signaling molecules, called **autoinducers**, which are produced by bacteria. The bacteria also possess receptors for these signaling molecules. When elevated numbers of bacteria are present in close proximity to each other, autoinducer concentration increases. Once the binding of autoinducer molecules has exceeded a certain threshold, a signaling cascade is initiated that modulates gene expression and in turn, modulates bacterial physiology to encourage community development. We will explore this in more depth in section 2.3. 

```{figure} Figures/Unit_2/2-1.png

Formation of a biofilm.  Biofilm communities can develop within hours. The detachment stage occurs through the loss of clumps of bacteria and biofilm or through the release of individual cells. This allows for propagation of new biofilms at near or distant surfaces (2).  
```

The physical biofilm formation process involves: 
1. Adherence of bacteria to a surface
2. Growth and production of EPS, resulting in much stronger (often irreversible) attachment leading to biofilm maturation. 
3. Dispersion of single cells (or parts of the biofilm) from the site of a **mature biofilm** (Fig 95).


The term **planktonic** refers to single bacterial cells that are growing in liquid (i.e., standard laboratory) culture, or to single bacterial cells swimming freely above a biofilm.  Planktonic bacteria can be recruited to a biofilm or may have “seeded” off of an existing biofilm.  Bacteria in a biofilm behave as a group, meaning they sense and respond to stimuli in a coordinated manner.  Some biofilm structures include a network of pores, held together by EPS, that provides a primitive circulatory system. Due to limitations in $O_2$ and nutrients, bacteria deep inside the biofilm will have a different physiology than the bacteria closer to the surface.

### 2.1.2 Prevalence of biofilms

A review in the Journal of Bacteriology had the following opening paragraph: *‘For over a century, microbiologists have studied liquid cultures of bacteria.  In fact, a common criterion for choosing a microorganism to study has been its ability to grow in a suspended, homogeneous culture format, thereby simplifying examination of microbial physiology and genetics.  Although these studies have been tremendously informative, they neglect the observation that many bacteria in the natural environment grow aggregated with each other, with solid surfaces, and at gas-liquid interfaces. There is a growing appreciation that, although clearly worthwhile, studies of standard planktonic cultures provide us with a biased view of microbial life. (3)’*

It is impossible to know the percent of bacteria in the environment that exist as planktonic versus biofilm.  However, a recent (2017) estimate from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that biofilms account for 65-80% of bacterial infections that physicians encounter (4)!
 
### 2.1.3 Biofilms in nature and in human disease

Biofilms can be commonly found environmentally as well as in association with biological “hosts”. They can be classified as either benign or pathogenic.

**Benign environmental biofilms** Examples include slippery coatings on rocks in streams, coatings on ship hulls, etc. Although these biofilms do not generally cause human disease, they are responsible for significant industrial problems such as corrosion.

**Pathogenic biofilms on medical implants.** A variety of bacteria, both Gram-negative and Gram-positive, readily form biofilms on many foreign devices implanted into human bodies. These bacteria account for significant human infection and disease. Examples of affected medical devices include:

- Urinary catheters
- Heart valve implants
- Hemodialysis equipment
- Dental implants

Pathogenic biofilms may also form on human body surfaces. Bodily surfaces provide an ideal environment for the formation of many different classes of biofilms. Many of these infections are caused by opportunistic pathogens that are also human commensals. Often the biofilm infections result in chronic disease that is difficult to treat with antibiotics. Examples of such infections include:

- Cystic fibrosis (CF) infections in the lung, caused by *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*
- Tuberculosis infections caused by *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*
- Urinary tract infections caused by *Escherichia coli*
- Ear infections (variety of bacteria)
- Tonsillitis (variety of bacteria)
- Oral biofilms. These biofilms are the primary causative agents of dental caries and gingivitis and are probably the best-studied model of biofilm communities in terms of human infection. Hundreds of species have been identified in oral bacterial communities, which are often very complicated. For instance, secondary colonizers such as *Fusobacterium spp.* join the *Streptococcus spp*.

Environmental biofilms may also impact human health. Some examples include the colonization of hot water systems in hospitals by *Mycobacterium avium*. Drinking water reservoirs may also be contaminated with *Salmonella typhimurium*. These ‘benign’ environmental biofilms can attract, recruit, and concentrate pathogenic bacteria that might not form a biofilm on their own. This has many implications, one of which is bioterrorism. For instance, biofilms on copper tubing have been shown to attract and concentrate *Bacillus anthracis* (anthrax) spores.

## 2.2 Treating Biofilms

### 2.2.1 Antimicrobial resistance and persistence of biofilms

A general characteristic of biofilm communities is that they can be significantly (i.e., >10,000 times) more resistant to antibiotics and antimicrobial stressors, including those mounted by natural host responses (i.e., the immune system), compared to planktonic bacteria of the same species. Biofilm properties thought to contribute to antimicrobial resistance include:

1. The EPS matrix. The complex EPS layer enmeshing the biofilm can significantly impede the penetration of antimicrobial agents to bacteria buried in the depths of the biofilm.

2. Nutrient and O2 availability. Bacteria within a biofilm are subject to nutrient and O2 gradients, meaning bacteria closer to the surface have significantly better access to nutrients and O2 than bacteria on the interior. Consequently, bacteria in the biofilm interior, while alive, are often metabolically inactive. Antibiotics are most effective against metabolically active cells; thus, bacteria in the interior are protected from this type of killing. 

3. ‘Persister’ cells. Sometimes, even though the majority of a biofilm may be killed by antimicrobial therapy, a very small percentage of the population will remain viable despite prolonged exposure to the antimicrobial or even increased dosage. These persisters generally confer no heritable resistance to progeny once the selective pressure is removed; however, this characteristic allows cells in a biofilm to survive for extremely long periods of time, a feature which likely contributes to long-term survival of bacterial species in general.

### 2.2.2 New pharmaceutical approaches to anti-biofilm therapy

While this is a very new area of research, some strategies currently being investigated include:  

1. Interfering with EPS synthesis. For instance, coating medical devices with chemicals that hinder matrix formation

2. Inhibiting adherence of biofilms to their surface substrate. Identifying chemicals that bind to bacterial cell surfaces will prevent formation of biofilms before they even begin

3. Targeting autoinducers. If the bacteria are unable to signal to each other, they will be unable to form or maintain a biofilm. Several strategies are underway to achieve this.

### 2.2.3 Biofilm regulatory systems

In order to form something as complex as a biofilm, bacteria rely on signal transduction systems. As was introduced in Unit 1 Chapter 5 with one- and two-component systems, a signal transduction system involves sensing environmental changes coupled with a response(s). During biofilm formation, two core signal transduction systems play a collective role in mediating biofilm formation, **quorum sensing** (sec 2.3) and **chemotaxis** (sec 2.4), which will be discussed in the next two sections. One of the things we hope that you appreciate is that although these systems may exist in many of the bacterial species that we have studied, how they work may vary greatly due to biological variation and diversity. However, in this course, you will learn how these systems work by studying the model organism, *E. coli*, as an extensible example of the core components of quorum sensing and chemotaxis.  

## Case Study: Investigating biofilm treatment and modes of study

Wang Y, Hoffmann JP, Baker SM, Bentrup KHZ, Wimley WC, Fuselier JA, Bitoun JP, Morici LA.  2021. Inhibition of Streptococcus mutans biofilms with bacterial-derived outer membrane vesicles. BMC Microbiol. 21(1):234. doi: 10.1186/s12866-021-02296-x. 
:::

**Overview**

Biofilms are complex environments of bacteria and other microbes that require cooperation and communication. A major mode of interbacterial communication is through outer membrane vesicles (OMV). While much of the bacterial interactions lead to a protective extracellular matrix that provides resistance to antibiotic treatment, some bacterial OMVs have been shown to disrupt other bacterial biofilms. Wang et al. hypothesized that *Burkholderia thailandensis* OMVs will possess antibiofilm activity against the common oral pathogen *Streptococcus mutans*.

In order to test this hypothesis, Wang et al. measured planktonic response, biofilm biomass, biofilm integrity, and bacterial cell viability via the following experiments:

**Step 1: Testing antimicrobial on planktonic growth**

```{note}
What are OMVs? (5)

Gram-negative bacteria are capable of shedding outer membrane vesicles in response to environmental stressors. These vesicles contain many components, including: small molecules, proteins, lipids, polysaccarides, and RNA/DNA encased in a liquid particle. This article states that previous work by their lab reported that non-pathogenic *B. thailandenis* OMWs possess antimicrobial compounds such as peptidoglycan hydrolases, HMNQ, and long-chain rhamnolipids.
```

Wang et al. first tested the *B. thailandenis* OMW’s effect on *S. mutans* planktonic growth (ie. non-biofilm cells).

```{figure} Figures/Unit_2/2-2.png

The antimicrobial activity of B. thailandenis OMVs against *S. mutans* was evaluated in planktonic cultures. *S. mutans* cultures were treated with PBS (empty buffer control) and varying concentrations of OMVs. **** indicates significant change in all cultures. 
```

Questions to consider:

1.	What is being measured here? Is this assay conducted on biofilm cells or non-biofilm cells?
2.	What is the control group and what are the treatment groups?
3.	How do the treatment groups compare to the control? Is this change significant?
4.	What does this say about the effectiveness of OMVs against planktonic *S. mutans*? 
:::


**Step 2: Antimicrobial activity in planktonic vs biofilm conditions**
Antimicrobial effects of OMVs and gentamicin in both planktonic and biofilm conditions were compared. This was measured by counting colony forming units (CFUs). 

```{margin} Gentamicin
Gentamicin is a common antibiotic used in the treatment of general bacterial infections and specifically has shown strong activity against *S. mutans* strains (6).

```
:::{grid-item-card}
**Questions to consider:**

1. What are the differences between Figure 97B and C?
2. What is the purpose of gentamicin in this experiment?
3. What extra information does Figure 97C tell us about OMV activity when compared to Figure 96?
4. What information can you gather about OMV treatment when comparing Figure 97B and Figure 97C?
5. Does this data support the hypothesis that OMVs from *B. thailandensis* possess antibiofilm activity against *S. mutans*?
:::

**Step 3: Further characterizing effects on biofilm formation**
			
Wang et al. Further characterized biofilm formation using fluorescent dyes, a common analysis technique.

```{note}
**Fluorescent Dyes**

Fluorescent dyes are small molecules that absorb and emit light at different wavelengths (7). These are often used to visualize cellular components, by using fluorescent dyes to specifically target cellular components. The dye SYTO 9 binds to nucleic acids of both live and dead cells (8). Propidium iodine (PI), on the other hand, is a nucleic acid dye that cannot permeate the cell membrane (9). Therefore, PI is used to stain dead cells.
```

1.	Which boxes represent the STYO 9 stained cultures in Figures 98a-c? The PI stained cultures?
2.	What does SYTO 9 fluorescent dye stain in Figures 98a-c represent? The PI dye? Merged?
3.	What aspect of Figures 98a-c is complementary to Figure 98d? Why?
4.	What aspect of Figures 98a-c is complementary to Figure 98e? Why?

6.	Are any of the data in this figure redundant with that presented in Figure 97b? Why?
7.	Does this data support the hypothesis that OMVs from *B. thailandensis* possess antibiofilm activity against S. mutans?

## 2.3 Quorum Sensing

For decades, microbiologists have tended to think of prokaryotic populations as collections of individual organisms reproducing and behaving independently. However, it has become clear that these organisms “talk to” each other using chemicals to coordinate their activities. In order to cooperate, prokaryotes need to be able to sense the presence of others of their own kind that are nearby in the environment. The mechanism to do this is called **quorum sensing** ("quorum" = "sufficient numbers").

Quorum sensing is a type of environmentally-regulated gene expression in which gene expression is regulated by population density. It is a way prokaryotes sense the presence of others of their own kind and work together. Large changes in gene expression change a cell’s phenotype from individualistic growth to community-based growth. 

Quorum sensing is used to ensure that sufficient numbers of a given species are present before initiating some response that requires a certain population density to have an effect. Several different quorum sensing mechanisms of varying complexity based on either one-component or two-component systems have evolved in prokaryotes to regulate gene expression in response to population density. Although they differ in the details of molecular mechanism, they all involve a communication chemical called an **autoinducer (AI)**.

### 2.3.1 Quorum sensing in *E. coli*

The Lsr quorum sensing system is one of *E. coli’s* more extensively studied systems. This system involves two operons as shown in Fig 99 (10,11). One operon contains the *lsrK* and *lsrR* genes which encode the two regulators in the system. The other operon consists of several genes, *lsrABCD*, that encode proteins involved in sensing and transporting the autoinducer into the cell when it reaches the threshold. LsrR being the major **global regulator** of the system is an inhibitor of its own operon and the *lsrABCD* operon. Interestingly, LsrR, even though it is the main regulator of this quorum sensing system, keeps the quorum sensing system shut off when cell concentration is low. It does so by repressing the expression of both operons which includes its own expression.

```{figure} Figures/Unit_2/2-5.png
:name: Fig99

Lsr quorum sensing system in *E. coli*.
```  

**Low population density.** LuxR is the enzyme responsible for synthesizing the autoinducer, called Autoinducer 2 or AI2, in this system. It does so by converting a molecule called DPD into AI2 which is transported out of the cell by the membrane-bound protein, YdgG. Even when population density is low, the cell continues to secrete AI2 as a way to indicate to other cells that it is present. 

**High population density.** As the population density increases, since the cells have been secreting AI2, the concentration of AI2 increases as well. Once this concentration reaches a threshold, the LsrABCD complex (membrane-bound) starts to import AI2 from the environment into the cell where LsrB specifically senses external AI2 levels. After AI2 is imported into the cell, AI2 is phosphorylated by LsrK. This phosphorylated form of AI2 binds to LsrR and relieves its repression of the two lsr operons to allow further production of quorum sensing proteins. 

```{note}
**Global Regulator**

Some transcriptional regulators are “promiscuous”. It means that they don’t just bind to a single promoter but can regulate the expression of multiple different genes and sometime in multiple different ways (ie. as an enhancer for some and repressor for others). A global regulator is one that regulates the expression of other transcriptional regulator causing a cascade of changes in gene expression of many genes. 
```

LsrR is a global regulator. This means that it not only regulates its own operon but several other genes in the cell including other regulators. Therefore, it can activate a cascade of changes in gene expression in the cell. These changes often result in the cell undergoing some form of community-based phenotype. LsrR can act as a transcriptional repressor or activator. Binding to AI2-P can change how it binds to certain promoters. 
 

## 2.4 Bacterial Motility and Chemotaxis

### 2.4.1 Chemotaxis vs Biofilm Formation

Biofilms are a bacteria’s response to persistent environmental changes leading individual bacteria to aggregate in large microbial communities of immobile cells. This requires a transformation from the planktonic bacterial lifestyle which often requires motility to respond to rapid fluctuations in their microenvironments. This responsive and motile lifestyle is dependent on a process called **chemotaxis** (12).

Chemotaxis is a change in motile behaviour as the result of sensing a chemical concentration difference (i.e. a concentration gradient) in the environment. It is an immediate change in behaviour that does not require the synthesis of any new proteins.
- Positive chemotaxis: the movement toward higher concentrations of chemical substances called **attractants** (eg. nutrients).
- Negative chemotaxis: the movement away from higher concentrations of chemical substances called **repellents** (eg. wastes, antimicrobial compounds).

### 2.4.2 Sensing

In order to exhibit chemotaxis, an organism must have a mechanism to sense when the environmental concentration of an attractant or repellant is increasing or decreasing and be able to respond to the environmental sensation in the appropriate way.

As far as sensing goes, in principle there are at least two ways to sense a chemical concentration gradient in the environment. In spatial sensing, a concentration difference is sensed by comparing the concentration of a chemical at two points in space at the same time using receptors at the front and back of the cell (Fig 100). In temporal sensing, a concentration difference is sensed by comparing the concentration of a chemical at two points in time (Fig 100). Why a prokaryote might use spatial or temporal sensing or both is not clear. Organism size, morphology, kind of motility and speed of motility have all been implicated.

```{figure} Figures/Unit_2/2-6.png
:name: Fig100

Spatial and temporal sensing used in chemotaxis.
```

### 2.4.3 Responding

The smooth forward motion of a swimming organism is called a **run**. A run is typically associated with flagellar rotation in the counter-clockwise rotation. Although we often relate the flagellum to a “tail”-like structure, note that it does not beat or flap like an animal tail but rather rotates using a motor.

As far as **monotrichous (have a single flagellum)** organisms go, some change direction by reversing flagellar rotation (to clockwise). This pulls the cell backward in an erratic way causing a random change in direction for a subsequent run to a twitching motion called **tumbling** (Fig 101). Others change direction by briefly stopping flagellar rotation. It is Brownian motion (random motion) that points them in a random direction for a subsequent run.

```{figure} Figures/Unit_2/2-7.png
:name: Fig101

Run and tumble in monotrichous cells.
```

In **peritrichous** organisms, multiple flagella are scattered over the cell surface while **lophotrichous** organisms possess a tuft of flagella at a single location. In lophotrichous and peritrichous Bacteria, the rotation of all flagella in one direction causes them to come together in a bundle and act in a coordinated manner resulting in running motion (Fig 102). While a “stop and go” method of changing direction could work, in the organisms studied so far, a change in direction is mediated by a tumble. A tumble results from a switch in the direction of rotation by at least one flagellum. When this occurs, the bundle "flys apart”, the run is disrupted and the bacterium undergoes chaotic 3D whirling motions = a tumble. Following a tumble, a subsequent run occurs in a random direction.

```{figure} Figures/Unit_2/2-8.png
:name: Fig102

Run and tumble in lophotrichous cells.
```

### 2.4.4 Chemotaxis in *E. coli*

Chemotaxis has been the most well-studied in peritrichously flagellated *E. coli* (Surprise! Surprise!) which changes direction by tumbling. As a model organism, we want to understand how chemotaxis works in *E. coli* by considering a default non-chemotactic conditions then considering conditions that may trigger running or tumbling. Although the information in this section is focused on *E. coli*, note that chemotaxis is a conserved mechanism across bacterial species that does have quite a bit of variability in regards to its overall functionality and the molecular pathways. 

**Default non-chemotactic conditions**

In the absence of a chemical concentration gradient, motility rarely results in net movement in any particular direction. Instead, cells follow a rather random pattern in a motion called **Brownian motion** (Fig 103). Under Brownian motion, there is no set end point or net directionality.

```{figure} Figures/Unit_2/2-9.png
:name: Fig103

Brownian motion in the absence of any chemical gradient.
```
Let’s now consider a situation where there a chemical gradient present. Depending on the chemical, if it promotes movement towards it, is considered a **chemoattractant**. If it causes the cells to move away from it, it is normally considered a **chemorepellent**. The relative position and type of chemical may promote either tumbling (to change direction) or running. We cannot say that a single type of chemical only promotes one type of reaction (ie. chemoattractants only promote running). It dependent on the location. If a chemoattract is behind a cell, it may tumble first to change direction then run towards it. If it senses the attractant in front of it, it will just keep running. 

#### Tumbling Motion

Here we are going to look at a simplified version of the molecular gears that define chemotaxis in *E. coli* (Fig 2.10). Clustered at the front of the cell, is a series of proteins called chemoreceptors. *E. coli* has several classes of **chemoreceptors** with Tar and Tsr being the most dominant. Chemoreceptors are bundled in high concentrations in order to be more sensitive to signals (robustness) and to promote signal amplification.  

If a chemorepellent, for example an antibiotic, is sensed in front of the cell, the following will occur to cause the cell to tumble and change direction (Fig 104):

1. One of the classes of chemoreceptors will sense the signal and activate CheA which is one of the many response regulators in the pathway. CheA is a kinase, an enzyme capable of phosphorylating other proteins. 
2. Once activated by the chemoreceptors, CheA will phosphorylate CheB in order to activate its enzymatic activity. CheB is a demethylase (an enzyme that removes methyl (-CH3) groups from other proteins). CheB demethylates CheA, the very protein that just activated it.
3. When CheA is demethylated, it is able to phosphorylate a second protein, CheY. 
4. When CheY is phosphorylated, it changes it conformation so that it can actively bind to the flagella motor switching its default, unbound rotation from counter-clockwise (CCW) to clockwise (CW) causing the cell to tumble and change direction. 

```{figure} Figures/Unit_2/2-10.png
:name: Fig104

Molecular pathway leading to tumbling in *E. coli*. Pi or P = phosphate groups, CH3 = methyl group.
```

#### Running Motion

Let’s consider now that the cell has successfully changed directions and now it wants to put the repellent behind it and run. There are two key enzymes involved in “resetting” the system. Resetting the system means going back to the default rotation of the flagella when it is not bound to CheY-P which is CCW, running rotation (Fig 105):

1. Once the cell senses that it is now facing a direction where the antibiotic concentration is lower, CheA will stop phosphorylating CheB and instead, CheR, a methylase, will start to methylate CheA to CheA-CH3.
2. CheA-CH3’s kinase activity is turned off so it no longer phosphorylates CheY. Instead, CheZ is going to dephosphorylate CheY changing its conformation so that it can no longer bind the flagellar motor.
3. The free, unbound motor rotates in CCW direction to promote running.

:::


**Overview**

Autoaggregation is a phenomenon where multiple bacterial cells come together and form a small cluster. The mechanisms of how autoaggregation occurs have been of interest to molecular microbiologists for a while now. In this paper, Laganenka et al. explore the potential that both quorum sensing and chemotaxis may play a role in regulating autoaggregation in *E. coli*. They hypothesize the *E. coli* responds to AI2 chemotactically to promote autoaggregation. 

Laganenka et al. studied this systematically by first looking into (1) the role of chemotaxis, then (2) quorum sensing, and finally (3) both in mediating autoaggregation. 

**Step 1: Exploring the role of chemotaxis in autoaggregation**

The researchers used knock-out mutants of genes involved in swimming motility, as this is an important phenotype regulated by chemotaxis, and chemotaxis genes on how *E. coli* cultures autoaggregate. The swimming genes include *flu, fliC, and motA*. The chemotaxis genes include *cheY, tar, tsr*.

**Questions to consider:**

1.	What technique was used to collect data in panels a-e?
2.	Look at the WT first, how does the culture change over time? What are characteristics of autoaggregates? 
3.	What does the OD600=6.0 mean? Is 6.0 considered a high OD level?
4.	How do each mutant compare to the WT? If it’s different, what does this say about the importance of that gene in mediating autoaggregation?
5.	Is swimming important for regulating autoaggregation?
6.	Is chemotaxis important for regulating autoaggregation?
7.	What is being measured in panel f? 
8.	Does the data in panel f match panels a-e? Are they comparable?
9.	Based on panel f, can you tell which genes are more or less important for regulating autoaggregation?

**Questions to consider:**

1.	For each panel, consider what technique is being used? What is being measured? 
2.	For panel A, what phase of growth is AI-2 produced the most?
