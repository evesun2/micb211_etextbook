## 4.1 Therapy and Prevention of Bacterial Diseases

### 4.1.1 Chemotherapeutic agents

The most prominent mode of combating infectious diseases involves the use of chemical compounds known as chemotherapeutic agents. These compounds can be used internally. This is in contrast to **antiseptics** which are chemical agents that are applied to living tissues to kill or inhibit the growth of microorganisms (these compounds are used for washing hands or treating surface wounds), or **disinfectants** which are chemical agents used on inanimate objects to kill microorganisms (most of these agents are too toxic to be used inside the body). The key requirement of chemotherapeutic agents is their selective toxicity; these compounds inhibit or kill bacteria without causing serious harm to the host.  Chemotherapeutic agents that are able to kill bacteria or inhibit the growth of bacteria are usually called **antibiotics**.

Antibiotics were initially differentiated from synthetic compounds, like Sulfa drugs, because they were the natural products derived from microbial activity. Many antibiotics have been modified by chemical changes carried out in the laboratory and are described as semi-synthetic antibiotics. In the 20th century, scientists have discovered ways to make or modify antibiotics, thus making the current antibiotic field an array of natural, **semi-synthetic and synthetic antibiotics**. The most commonly used antibiotics in hospitals are the beta-lactams.  These consist of the naturally derived penicillin-like and cephalosporin antibiotics and their many semi-synthetic derivatives.  Notably, they contain a common 4-membered ring termed the beta-lactam ring  (Fig 122).

```

The sensitivity of microorganisms to antibiotics and other chemotherapeutic agents varies.  Gram-positive bacteria are usually more sensitive to antibiotics than Gram-negative bacteria.  A **broad-spectrum antibiotic** (sometimes called a ‘chemotherapeutic agent’) is one that acts on both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and is more frequently used in medicine; a **narrow-spectrum antibiotic** is one that acts on only a single group of organisms (which may still be useful if a broad-spectrum antibiotic fails to resolve an infection, or for special organisms like *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*).

**Optimal attributes of chemotherapeutic agents are:** 

- Solubility in body fluids with good penetration to the infection site
- Effectiveness against bacteria at a low concentration, i.e., a low MIC (see section 4.2.2)
- A broad spectrum of activity i.e., activity against a broad range of bacteria.  Individual antibiotics tend to vary in their activity spectrum
- Low frequency of resistance development
- Low toxicity, well-tolerated in the human body
- Non-allergenic

Antibiotics don’t always possess all of these optimal attributes, but they do tend to be safe and effective drugs. After having covered the microbiota in Unit 2 Chap 1, consider how antibiotic therapy could affect a person’s health through the microbiota.

### 4.1.2 How antibiotics generally work

For an antibiotic to be useful in medicine, it must be able to inhibit bacterial growth or kill bacterial cells but not affect host cells.  For example, the antibiotic can target a metabolic process that is not found in the host cell, or the antibiotic can target a bacterial protein that is sufficiently different from the homologous protein in the host cell.  

Chemotherapeutic agents kill or inhibit the growth of bacteria by a variety of different mechanisms. The primary way that most antibiotics work is by targeting and often inhibiting a key process in bacterial growth and/or survival (eg. transcription, translation, DNA replication) (Fig 123). The reason(s) they don’t also kill our cells at the prescribed dose is sometimes clear, sometimes not. Some examples of antibiotics and their activity are listed in Table 4.1 

```{figure} Figures/Unit_2/4-2.png

Different antibiotics kill or inhibit the growth of bacteria by targeting different parts of bacterial metabolism.

## 4.2 Testing for Antibiotic Sensitivity

### 4.2.1 Disk Diffusion Assay

Antibiotic therapy may be started immediately without actual knowledge of the identity of the pathogen or the pathogen’s sensitivity to antibiotics.  However, such information is critical if there is a subsequent lack of therapeutic response in the patient.  One simple method to determine the antibiotic sensitivity of a clinical isolate (ie. strain of bacteria isolated from a medical case) is the disk diffusion antibiotic susceptibility test (Fig 124).

```{figure} Figures/Unit_2/4-3.png
:name: Fig124

Antibiotic sensitivity testing. In the above image, the bacteria are sensitive to all antibiotics except #4 and #6.
```

In this test, the bacterial isolate is spread evenly onto the surface of an agar plate so that when the bacteria grow, it will form a confluent lawn. Paper discs impregnated with various antibiotics are placed on the surface of the plate and the antibiotic is allowed to diffuse into the culture medium. As the bacteria on the lawn grow, they are inhibited to varying degrees by the antibiotic diffusing from the disk.  Inhibition of bacterial growth around a disk following incubation indicates sensitivity to the particular antibiotic contained in the disk.  The radius of the bacteria free circular zones is referred to as the “**zone of inhibition**”. The size of the zone of inhibition is dependent on the diffusion rate of the antibiotic, the degree of sensitivity of the microorganism, and the growth rate of the bacterium.  The test is performed under standardized conditions. The zones of inhibition under standard conditions have been established for each antibiotic.  If the zone of inhibition is equal to or greater than the standard, the organism is considered to be sensitive or **susceptible** to the antibiotic.  If the zone of inhibition is less than the standard, the organism is considered to be **resistant**.


### 4.2.2 Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC)

Antibiotics can be classified as **bactericidal** (kill the bacteria) or **bacteriostatic** (inhibit bacterial growth without directly killing) (1).  When the concentration of bacteriostatic antibiotics falls below a certain concentration (the minimal inhibitory concentration or MIC) the bacteria start to grow again, whereas with bactericidal antibiotics, the bacteria cannot grow when the concentration falls below the MIC (1).  

The MIC of an antibiotic against a specific bacteria can be determined by finding the lowest concentration of antibiotic that prevents visible bacterial growth. MICs are the “gold standard” of determining bacterial susceptibility to an antibiotic, and they are utilized when other methods, for example disk diffusion, lack definitive results (2). To perform the MIC measurement, bacteria are exposed to a range of antibiotic concentrations on either liquid or solid growth media (Fig 125 shows an example using liquid media dispensed into a 96-well plate). The antibiotic and growth conditions will be case dependent.

## Case Study: Antibiotic susceptibility in *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*

:::{grid-item-card}

:::


**Overview**

*Mycobacterium tuberculosis* is the causative agent of tuberculosis and historically the leading cause of death due to infectious disease globally. While that title has been replaced by COVID-19, it is still the leading cause of death due to bacterial infection. Due to drug resistance and difficult treatment regimes, new antimicrobials are in desperate need. This study aims to identify a compound whose antimicrobial activity against M. tuberculosis is enhanced in the presence of copper. The rational for this combination is the utilization of copper by the host immune system as a natural antimicrobial. The chemical compound investigated in this study is the broad-spectrum antimicrobial, 8-hydroxyquinoline (8HQ). Dalecki et al. hypothesized that 8HQ activity is enhanced in the presence of copper both *in vitro* and *in vivo*.

```{margin} *in vitro and in vivo*
Common terms used to describe studies of pathogens are *in vitro* and *in vivo*. *In vitro* is Latin for “in the glass” and refers to artificial conditions generated in a laboratory setting. *In vivo*, on the other hand, is Latin for “within the living” and refers to analysis of pathogens within living cells or organisms. In this case, macrophages are living immune cells and more closely model infection conditions than what the bacteria would experience in growth media (4).
```

In order to test this hypothesis, Dalecki et al. had to go through the following steps:

 
**Step 1: Determining MIC of 8HQ ± Copper**

The effect of copper on 8HQ activity was determined through calculating change in MIC. This was monitored in growing (G) and recovering (R) bacteria.

```{note}
**Growing vs. Recovering M. tuberculosis**

One of the major features of disease caused by M. tuberculosis is the transition from actively replicating bacteria (growing) to a dormant, non-replicating cell (recovery) (3). This can make treating this pathogen with antibiotics difficult as they often target processes found in growing bacterial cells. In this study, dormant bacteria were induced “artificially” outside of the host and were therefore considered recovering once they were placed into the growth conditions used to measure MICs (3).

**Questions to consider:**

1.	Based on this figure, what are the MICs under each condition?
2.	What is the purpose of showing both panels A and B? Are there differences in the data?
3.	What is the purpose of looking at both growing and recovering *M. tuberculosis* cells? What do the results in both groups tell us about 8HQ - Cu activity, 8HQ + Cu activity?
4.	Does this data support the hypothesis that copper enhances the antimicrobial activity of 8HQ?

**Step 2: Determining Effect of 8HQ ± Copper during infection**

To determine the efficacy of 8HQ *in vivo*, growth of *M. tuberculosis* in macrophages (a type of immune cell) was monitored.

5.	Does this data support the hypothesis that copper enhances the antimicrobial activity of 8HQ?

## 4.3 Antibiotic Resistance

### 4.3.1 Acquiring Resistance – Bacteria

The acquired ability of microorganisms to resist the effects of an antibiotic to which it is normally sensitive is known as **antibiotic resistance**.  Antibiotic resistance in bacterial infections was first observed shortly after the first antibiotic was introduced into clinical use in the 1940s.  

Not all antibiotics act against all microorganisms. Bacteria may be naturally resistant to an antibiotic because they lack the structures that the antibiotic inhibits. For example, mycoplasmas (a causative agent of pneumonia) are resistant to penicillin because they lack peptidoglycan. Another reason a bacterium may be resistant is because many organisms naturally possess rather non-specific efflux pumps that transport antibiotics out of the organism before the drug can be effective. Some Gram-negative bacteria are naturally resistant to some types of antibiotic due to a combination of poor permeability across the outer membrane combined with secondary mechanisms such as efflux and antibiotic inactivating enzymes that take advantage of the slow uptake of antibiotics into the bacterial cell. This is known as **intrinsic resistance**, a regular or natural feature of the bacteria that allows it to resist the antibiotic.  

Bacteria can also be resistant to antibiotics by modifying the target of the antibiotic.  For example, bacteria can become resistant to a given antibiotic because of mutations that change the structure of the target site (common in bacteria that are producing the antibiotic), alter a metabolic pathway, or change the permeability of the outer membrane. These mutations typically occur naturally during DNA replication, when ‘mistakes’ are made that actually benefit the bacteria in the presence of an antibiotic. These mutations are then passed to the progeny of the cell (**vertical gene transfer**) during cell division to create a larger pool of antibiotic resistant bacteria. This is known as **acquired resistance**. 

Alternatively, some bacteria carry specific genetic information (‘**resistance genes**’) that renders them resistant to the antibiotic they produce. For example, they may have a gene that encodes an enzyme that can modify the antibiotic by breaking a bond or by adding a phosphate group.  Sensitive bacteria can acquire resistance genes through horizontal gene transfer (Unit 1 Chapter 4). 

### 4.3.2 Acquiring Resistance – Human Contributions

When discussing antibiotic resistance, it is important to note that exposure to antibiotics does not cause bacteria to become drug resistant. Changes in the bacterium that enable it to resist the antibiotic occur naturally as a result of mutation or genetic exchange and recombination. Exposure to the antibiotic selects for outgrowth of the bacteria that have become resistant through natural selection.

Resistance may develop in bacteria through the natural process of mutation and genetic recombination, but antibiotic abuse encourages the emergence of antibiotic resistant forms. A number of surveys suggest that antibiotics are used in clinical practice far more often than is necessary. Data suggests that antibiotic treatment is warranted for only 20% of individuals seen for clinical infections, yet antibiotics are prescribed up to 80% of the time. Furthermore, in up to 50% of cases, the recommended doses or duration of treatment are not correct. 

To add to this problem, many people fail to complete their prescriptions. Many patients stop taking their antibiotics as soon as they are ‘feeling better.’  Thus, the virulent pathogens are subjected to sub-lethal doses of antibiotics and remain alive to evolve into resistant organisms. Upon using the same antibiotic in the future, it will kill the sensitive bacteria (even those bacteria that are beneficial), leaving the resistant bacteria to thrive because they face reduced competition from susceptible organisms. 

Hospitals are another environment driving the emergence of resistant bacteria. In many cases, large doses of antibiotics are used to prevent infection during and following surgery. Finally, antibiotics are often available in developing countries without prescription. 

The largest area of antibiotic misuse is within the agricultural industries. Statistics from 2016 indicate that in North America, approximately 80% of the antibiotics produced are used in agriculture. Up to 90% of those are not used to treat sick animals, but rather as growth-promoting agents in livestock and for the prophylactic treatment of livestock, crops, and farmed fish. 

Fortunately, government agencies in both Canada and the U.S. are now creating much stricter regulations which came into effect in 2017 and 2018, which should bring those numbers down considerably. There is strong evidence that the use of antibiotics in agriculture results in antibiotic resistance in bacteria that can then be transferred to humans through handling these animals and food consumption. Aquaculture is another area in which concerns have been raised regarding antibiotic use in the environment. An example of this is shown in Figure 128. 

*Campylobacter jejuni* is a major foodborne pathogen causing severe diarrheal disease. It can easily be acquired in North America through the consumption of mishandled poultry products and is often the leading cause of food poisoning in developed countries. However, it is much more likely to be acquired when traveling abroad. Ciprofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone, is the first-line antibiotic prescribed by travel doctors in case the traveler contracts a severe case of diarrhea. Unfortunately, as even this older graph shows, due to use in agriculture and over-the-counter availability, fluoroquinolones are not the best option at present, especially in certain parts of the world.

```

### 4.3.3 A global crisis

The emergence and spread of multi-drug-resistant pathogens has increased substantially over the past twenty years. The most obvious consequence of antibiotic use has been the increased rates of mortality when physicians are not able to treat patients effectively and in a timely manner. In some cases, the only drugs available to treat a particular infection have been rendered ineffective because of antibiotic resistance. 

New **superbugs** that are resistant to most or all types of antibiotic treatment have arisen (e.g., MRSA: methicillin-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus*, VRE: vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus; imipenem resistant *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*, penicillin resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae).  These superbugs are resistant to many different antibiotics.

A great concern is the rise of multidrug resistant and extensively drug resistant M. tuberculosis. Due to its long-standing status as the leading cause of death due to infectious disease (just recently out ranked by COVID-19), these drug resistant strains are severely increasing the global burden of this pathogen. These strains can be resistant to several if not all of the front-line drugs and some second-line drugs, greatly reducing number of effective antibiotics for treatment. Furthermore, antibiotic resistance is costly. For example, the total cost of treatment of antibiotic susceptible tuberculosis (in USD) is `$`18,000 whereas the treatment of the most antibiotic resistant tuberculosis can cost `$`513,000 per patient. There is also increased mortality (5).

In order to combat the increasing global occurrence of antimicrobial and antibiotic resistant bacteria, in 2015 the World Health Organization (WHO) endorsed a Global Action Plan. You can see more information on the details of this plan and the global strategies at the WHO Global Action Plan webpage: (https://ahpsr.who.int/publications/i/item/global-action-plan-on-antimicrobial-resistance)

 
## Case Study: Antibiotic resistance in *Mycobacteroides abscessus*

This case study was adapted from: **Dal Molin et al., 2017**

Dal Molin M, Gut M, Rominski A, Haldimann K, Becker K, Sander P. Molecular Mechanisms of Intrinsic Streptomycin Resistance in Mycobacterium abscessus. Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2017 Dec 21;62(1):e01427-17. doi: 10.1128/AAC.01427-17.
:::

**Overview**

*Mycobacterium abscessus* is a closely related pathogen to *M. tuberculosis* and also a leading agent of lung disease in immunocompromised individuals. One of the struggles faced when treating *M. abscessus* infections is the highly drug resistant nature of this pathogen. In fact, *M. abscessus* is resistant to streptomycin, the first ever drug used in the treatment of tuberculosis. In order to determine a genetic determinant of resistance, the authors of this study identified the gene encoding the enzyme MAB_2385 as a potential resistance gene. Notice that this gene doesn’t even have a proper name. It is because it has not been well studied and described. Dal Molini et al. hypothesized that presence of MAB_2385 in the *M. abscessus* genome leads to streptomycin resistance.

In order to test this hypothesis, Dal Molin et al. underwent the following experiments:

**Step 1: Determining MIC of streptomycin in *M. abscessus* ± MAB_2385**

MICs were determined using a streptomycin Etest. This was performed on wild type M. abscessus, the MAB_2385 knockout, and a complement strain of this knockout

```{note}
**Etests**

An Etest combines both the concepts of a disk diffusion and MIC assay (7). Etests are a method of determining MICs by using a permeable strip (similar to the disk in disk diffusion) on a bacterial lawn. They contain a gradient of antibiotic along the length of the strip that allow you to determine the MIC based on the ability of a bacteria to grow around the strip. The antibiotic concentrations are indicated numerically along the length to allow you to estimate the MIC (7).

```

**Step 2: Heterologously expressing MAB_2385 in *Mycobacterium smegmatis***

To further test the ability of MAB_2385 to induce streptomycin resistance, an expression plasmid (pMV361-aac(3)IV-MAB_2385) containing the gene was transformed into another, closely related bacterium, *M. smegmatis* which known to not have this gene naturally in its genome. The MICs for the WT and transformed strains were measured  as shown in Table 4.2.
